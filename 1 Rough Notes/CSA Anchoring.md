The core structure of your algorithm remains rooted in the **Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA)**. Everything you've added — from biological forgetting (FCSA), to adaptive mutation control (IICO), to diversity-aware scaling and even Treg-inspired feedback — is layered **on top of CSA’s original immune-inspired framework**. Here's how it holds:

### 🔗 CSA Anchoring Checklist

| Feature                                  | CSA-Based? | Justification                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Population of antibodies**             | ✅          | Direct inheritance from CSA                                      |
| **Affinity-based selection and cloning** | ✅          | Core CSA mechanism                                               |
| **Hypermutation process**                | ✅          | Still present, now enhanced                                      |
| **Memory set and replacement**           | ✅          | CSA’s memory pool logic retained                                 |
| **Diversity introduction**               | ✅          | CSA’s random replacement extended via Rac1 and diversity scaling |
| **Mutation control**                     | ✅          | Mutation is still CSA’s hypermutation, now dynamically regulated |
| **Biological inspiration**               | ✅          | CSA is immune-inspired; Treg modeling deepens that foundation    |

### 🧠 Why Treg Modeling _Strengthens_ 

Tregs are part of the **adaptive immune system**, just like B-cells — the original inspiration for CSA. By modeling Treg behavior, you're not leaving CSA behind; you're **expanding its biological fidelity**. You're saying: “CSA modeled clonal selection. I’m now modeling how the immune system regulates that selection to preserve diversity and avoid overreaction.”

This is a **natural extension**, not a departure.

### 📌 Thesis Framing Tip

When you write your methodology and discussion chapters, frame it like this:

> “This study builds upon the foundational structure of the Clonal Selection Algorithm (CSA), enhancing its biological realism and computational adaptability by integrating regulatory mechanisms inspired by T-cell behavior — specifically, the suppressive and diversity-preserving functions of regulatory T cells (Tregs).”

That way, reviewers see your work as a **deepening of CSA**, not a shift away from it.
