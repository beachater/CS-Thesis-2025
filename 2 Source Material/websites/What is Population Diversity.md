# What is Population Diversity

Population diversity is a measure of individuals' search information in population-based algorithms. From the distribution of individuals and change of this distribution information, the algorithm's status of exploration or exploitation can be obtained.

Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) mimic the natural selection and genetic inheritance principles. EA samples a population of candidate solutions, and new solutions are generated through selection, mutation and crossover operations. Promising solutions are selected for the next generation. EAs are robust in handling noisy optimization problems. The performance of EA may deteriorate when level of noise is high. Few notable draw backs of EA include fine tuning the control parameters associated with the algorithm according to the problem and premature convergence.

The use of a population allows evolutionary algorithms to explore different areas of the search space, facilitating global exploration. It also enables the use of recombination, where the hope is to combine good features of two solutions.

[Chapter 5 - Crossover and Its Effects | Algorithm Afternoon](https://algorithmafternoon.com/books/genetic_algorithm/chapter05/)

In genetic algorithms, crossover is defined as the process of combining genetic information from two parent solutions to generate one or more offspring solutions. This operator is a cornerstone of genetic algorithms, as it enables the creation of new solutions by mixing and matching the genetic material of existing solutions.


also from ako re-read sa atong paper atong miagi ako na wonder jud why na butang jud tong dynamic mutation on top sa hybrid (supposed to handle population diversity) and from the meeting gahapon rag nalimtan nakog raised kai na focus sad ta atong high dimensional nga problem

so nag read ko gamay unsa about ang problem ang high dimensional and also ako gisabay unsa sad tong population diversity para naay clear thought jud sa problem and what i found about kai:

- high dimensional problem is indeed kanang naga involved og lots variables and possibilities in which mo involved nag millions and billions of possibilities so crucial siya for combination problems or population based problems (like kaning CSA na atong gina tackled) since naga involved mag millions of possibilities from the population (i assume nga dani tong mutation and update kai since naga kuha man sila og other parts nga high affinity so sort of combination na) - see the link above "everyday-lessons-from-high-dimensional-optimization"
	

- the other is ang population diversity is handled nana siya dapat sa any EA or genetic algorithms since mostly population based mana sila, not doing so is mag the same na sila sa other algorithms nga local search (see pics for the notes) 
  
  so kaning mga base algo na handle niya nag population diversity (strong man or not) the CSA/CLONALG paper mentioned also: 
  
  "After discussing the clonal selection theory and the affinity maturation process, the development and implementation of CLONALG is straightforward. The main immune aspects taken into account to develop the algorithm are: 1) maintenance of a specific memory set; 2) selection and cloning of the most stimulated Ab’s; 3) death of nonstimulated Ab’s; 4) affinity maturation; and 5) reselection of the clones proportionally to their antigenic affinity, generation, and maintenance of diversity."

	and 
	
	"The number of low-affinity Ab’s to be replaced (Step 8 of the algorithm) is of extreme importance for the introduction and maintenance of diversity in the population"
