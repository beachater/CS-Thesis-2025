> > Inspired by the forgetting mechanism, for each antibody in the candidate antibody set, calculate the number of times it is selected as the top n affinity and the number of iterations in the candidate antibody set and use these two as antibody characteristics. These antibody characteristics were used as the basis for the change of Rac1 activity, and the activation degree of Rac1 determined whether to eliminate the “stranded” antibody from the concentration of candidate antibodies.
