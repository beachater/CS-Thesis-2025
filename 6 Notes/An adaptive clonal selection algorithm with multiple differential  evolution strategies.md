# An adaptive clonal selection algorithm with multiple differential  evolution strategies

However, most mutation operators in conventional clonal selection algorithms have semi-blindness and lack an effective guidance mechanism, which has thus become one of the important factors restricting the performance of algorithms.

(1) an adaptive mutation strategy pool based on its historical records of suc cess is introduced to guide the immune response process effectively; 

(2) an adaptive pop ulation resizing method is adopted to speed up convergence; and 

(3) a premature convergence detection method and a stagnation detection method are proposed to allevi ate premature convergence and stagnation problems in the evolution by enhancing the diversity of the population.

It is well known that mutation operators play an important role in CSAs. Many experimental studies have found that most mutation operators in conventional CSAs have great randomness and lack an effective guidance mechanism; thus, the semi-blindness in mutation operators causes the antibody evolution to be a trial-and-error process

> >  It begins with the initial population randomly generated by a uniform distribution and ensures that the population covers the entire solution space as much as possible. Then, the population will go through a number of iterations of the evolution process. In each generation, a mutant vector with respect to each individual, the so-called target vector, is generated by a mutation operation. After mutation, each pair of the target vector and the corresponding mutant vector use a crossover operation to produce a trial vector.

> > . It uses archived inferior solutions and multiple best solutions to provide the information of the evolutionary direction; thus, it can effectively improve the performance of ”DE/ current-to-best” by increasing the population diversity in multimodal problems

> Here, each clonal antibody adopts a separate mutation strategy in the strategy pool to create a mutant antibody. It is worth noting that only the ‘‘DE/rand/1” and ‘‘DE/current-to-pbest/1 with an archive” strategies are used with a binomial crossover operation, while the DE/current-rand/1 strategy is not needed



A larger value of F can increase the disturbance of the current solution by the difference vectors, and improve the population diversity and the global search ability of the algo rithm. Nevertheless, since the mutant vectors are widely distributed in the search space, the population has low convergence speed. In contrast, a lower value of F can reduce the influences from the difference vector and make the exploration near the current solution, thereby enhanceing the local search ability of the algorithm and accelerating its convergence. The crossover probability CR is used to determine how many components of the trial vectors are inherited from the mutant vectors. With the value of CR increasing, more components are inherited, which is beneficial to speed up convergence.

Therefore, our proposed algorithm adopts an adaptive parameter control mechanism inspired by LSHADE-EpSin [24] where each individual has its own scaling factor F and crossover probability CR. The main difference between our algorithm and LSHADE-EpSin is that our algorithm adopts a strategy pool with multiple strategies, while LSHADE-EpSin uses a single DE strategy. In our algorithm, each mutation strategy is assigned its independent historical memory pool. Specifically, each mutation strategy k maintains a historical memory MF k with H entries for storing historical mean values of F, and a historical memory MCR k with H entries for storing historical mean values of CR. The last elements are set to fixed values equal to 0.9 during the evolution process. In the initialization phase, other elements in MF k and MCR k are set to 0.5, and the structures of the historical memories are shown in Fig. 1.

> > Antibody population size plays an important role in affecting performance. The smaller population size implies a faster convergence speed but simultaneously increases the chances of premature convergence in the antibody population. On the other hand, the larger population size can fully explore the search space but slows down the convergence speed. Thus, we adopted a linear population size reduction designed in L-SHADE, which linearly reduces the antibody population according to a function of the number of affinity function evaluations. The antibody population size in the next generation g + 1 is computed as follows.

> > Obviously, as the current number of function evaluations increases, the variance r decreases. Thus, Gaussian walks have a stronger exploration ability at the initial stage of evolution and a stronger exploitation ability at the later stage of evolution. Once the Gaussian walks are finished, the new antibodies are selected as candidates to replace the best antibodies in the antibody pool. If the affinities of the candidates are lower than those of the best antibodies, then the best antibodies will be replaced.

> >  In the early evolution stage, antibodies are generated whose affinities are much higher than the average affinity of the current population. After ‘‘survival of the fittest” selection, these antibodies occupy most of the current population, resulting in reduced the population diversity and evolutionary ability; thus, the population easily falls into a local optimum. Stagnation is another situation in which the antibody population remains diverse and is unconverged, but the CSA is still unable to find any better solutions. Therefore, we propose a premature convergence detection method and a stagnation detection method based on population distribution, and then give the corresponding strategy to deal with these situation

> > To verify the effectiveness of the ADECSA, our experimental study is conducted in the following aspects. First, we compare the performance of the ADECSA with state-of-the-art CSA and DE variants. Second, convergence comparisons are performed between ADECSA and other CSA and DE variants. Third, the influence of the antibody population size on the algorithm performance is studied by sensitivity analysis. Fourth, we analyze the benefit of each component in ADECSA on algorithm performance. Fifth, the effect of each mutation strategy is investigated during the evolutionary process.
